- 👋 Hi, I’m @cipriano-sebastiao – code wrangler by day, psych explorer by night!
- 👀 I’m interested in decoding human minds and crunching numbers to uncover hidden stories in data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Python – transforming raw data into insights, one query at a time!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mind-bending data projects that blend psychology and analytics for maximum impact.
- 📫 How to reach me: Ping me on [www.linkedin.com/in/cipriano-sebastiao] or email me at [ciprianogertrudes@gmail.com] – I’m quicker to respond than a well-optimized algorithm!
