- 👋 Hi, I’m @cipriano – psych candidate by day, code wrangler by night!
- 👀 I’m interested in decoding human minds and crunching numbers to uncover hidden stories in data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python and Machine Learning – transforming raw data into insights, one query at a time!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mind-bending data projects that blend psychology and analytics to solve real-world problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: Ping me on [Cipriano Sebastiao](www.linkedin.com/in/cipriano-sebastiao) or email me at [ciprianogertrudes@gmail.com](ciprianogertrudes@gmail.com) – I’m quicker to respond than a well-optimized algorithm!
